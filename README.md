# Spectacle
Blockchain Hackathon Project; LionHack by Blockchain@Columbia

Bringing a web3 approach to freelancing. Our specific application during this hackathon: Creating jobs for video live streaming and verifying constraints. E.g. a journalist wants live video material at a certain location: They can post the constraints such as location, bounty per minute, video length, etc. 

In our project we use solidity to code the smart contracts, Remix to deploy and test the contracts, as well as Ganache for local testing environment.
